# ResumeEnhancer âœ¨

**Instantly analyze your resume against any job description to land your next interview.**

ResumeEnhancer is an intelligent platform designed to bridge the gap between talented job seekers and their dream jobs. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide data-driven feedback, helping you optimize your resume for each specific application.

## The Problem

-   For **Job Seekers**: Manually tailoring a resume for every job application is tedious and time-consuming. It's often hard to know which keywords and skills to include to pass through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and catch a recruiter's eye.
-   For **Recruiters**: Sifting through hundreds of non-relevant resumes is a major bottleneck. Identifying the most qualified candidates quickly is a constant challenge.

## Our Solution

ResumeEnhancer solves this by providing instant, actionable insights.

## How It Works

The application's core is a Python backend powered by FastAPI that performs several NLP tasks:

1.  **Text Extraction**: Parses text content from uploaded resume files.
2.  **Text Processing**: Cleans and standardizes the text from both the resume and job description by removing stop words and punctuation.
3.  **Keyword & Skill Extraction**: Uses TF-IDF and other NLP models to identify the most significant terms and skills in the job description.
4.  **Similarity Scoring**: Calculates the cosine similarity between the resume and the job description to generate the final match score.

This entire process is delivered through a clean and responsive React frontend, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Project Goals & Roadmap

Our vision is to build a comprehensive career toolkit. Here's what we're planning next:

-   [ ] **User Accounts**: Allow users to save their resumes and track their application history.
-   [ ] **Recruiter Portal**: A dashboard for recruiters to screen multiple candidates efficiently.
-   [ ] **Interactive Editor**: Enable users to edit their resume text directly on the platform and see the score change in real-time.
-   [ ] **Advanced NLP Models**: Integrate more sophisticated models (like BERT) for deeper semantic understanding.
